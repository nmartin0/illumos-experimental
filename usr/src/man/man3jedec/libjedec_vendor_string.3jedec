.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn libjedec_vendor_string
function translates a JEDEC vendor ID into a corresponding name.
JEDEC vendor IDs are defined in the JEP106 standard.
Vendor IDs come in banks and each bank contains up to 126 unique vendor
names.
To accommodate more than 126 vendors, a series of continuation bytes --
repeated values of 0x7f -- are used to indicate the bank.
Most implementations, like SPD data, don't actually encode multiple
continuations in the data, but rather just how many continuations are
present.
Note, the JEP106 standard describes the first bank as bank 1; however,
the library is phrased in terms of the number of continuations due to
how hardware encodes this data.
.Pp
The value in
.Fa cont
should indicate the number of continuations present.
The value in
.Fa vendor
indicates the vendor to look for and should include its parity bit.
When the name is successfully found, a pointer to a constant string with
the vendor's current name is returned.
Note that a given vendor's name may be changed over time due to
acquisitions.
When the value doesn't correspond to a known name then
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Pp
Currently the data reflects the JEP106BL data from Feburary 2025.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn libjedec_vendor_string
function returns a pointer to a vendor's name.
Otherwise
.Dv NULL
is returned to indicate that there is no mapping for the specified IDs.
