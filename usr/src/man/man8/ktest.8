.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
facility provides in situ kernel testing by running test code in
kernel context; essentially unit tests for the kernel.
The
.Nm
command is used to list or run registered kernel tests.
The
.Nm
command interacts with the in-kernel ktest facility by way of the
.Pa /dev/ktest
pseudo device.
A process must run in the Global Zone and have the
.Sy PRIV_SYS_DEVICES
privilege in order to access the device.
.Sh SUBCOMMANDS

.Sh OUTPUT
Available tests and the results of running said tests are emitted by the
.Cm list
and
.Cm run
commands, respectively.
.Ss OPTIONS
Output from the
.Cm list
and
.Cm run
commands is controlled by the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl H
Omit column headers when printing output.
.It Fl o Ar field Ns Op ,...
A case-insensitive, comma-separated list of output fields to display.
.Pp
The available fields and their contents are described in
.Sx FIELDS
section below.
.It Fl p
Display in a machine-parsable format and elide test stats output when
executing the
.Cm run
command.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
option is required with
.Fl p .
.El
.Ss FIELDS
The following is a list of output fields used by the
.Nm
command along with their meanings.
.Bl -tag -offset 4m -width 8m
.It Sy MODULE
The module name of the test.
This is typically the same name as the module-under-test.
.It Sy SUITE
The suite name of the test.
.It Sy TEST
The name of the test.
.It Sy INPUT
For the
.Sy list
command this indicates if the test requires an input stream: [Y]es or [N]o.
For the
.Sy run
command, it is the path to the input stream.
.El
The following fields are only applicable to the
.Cm run
command.
.Bl -tag -offset 4m -width 8m
.It Sy LINE
The source code line number that produced the test
.Sy RESULT .
All
.Sy PASS
and
.Sy NONE
results have a value of 0.
Upon detection of multiple results this value indicates the line that
overwrote the previous result and the
.Sy RESULT
field contains a message with the line number of the previous result.
.It Sy RESULT
The test result.
The
.Sx TEST RESULTS
section explains the different types of results.
.It Sy REASON
Additional context when the test result is one of
.Sy FAIL ,
.Sy ERROR ,
or
.Sy SKIP .
.El
.Ss TEST RESULTS
The different types of results that a test can produce.
.Bl -tag -offset 4m -width 8m
.It Sy PASS
The test passed.
.It Sy FAIL
The test had a logical failure (one of its assertions failed).
.It Sy ERROR
The test had an unexpected, non-logical error.
This is typically caused by a failure to acquire resources or an error
attempting some operation that is tangential to the logic under test.
.It Sy SKIP
The test decided to skip itself because it lacks the context required to run
the test.
For example, some type of missing resource or hardware.
.It Sy NONE
The test failed to produce a result.
This is a bug in the test and should be fixed.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It 0
Successful completion of the command.
For the
.Sy run
command, this also indicates that all tests produced a PASS or SKIP result.
.It 1
An error occurred while executing the command.
For the
.Sy run
command, this also indicates that one or more tests produced
a result other than PASS or SKIP.
.It 2
An invalid combination of command line options or arguments were
specified.
.El
